# Categorized NAS papers

 This useful website contains a regularly updated list of NAS papers.

> https://www.automl.org/automl/literature-on-neural-architecture-search/

For faster localization of papers in a specific area, I am trying categorizing these papers and summarizing the key words. This categorization is based on my own understanding, and might contain some misclassifications. I would be grateful for any feedback that points out these mistakes.

Following the traditions, the papers accepted at conferences and journals are in **bold**. Hopefully it can provide some guidance towards high-quality papers.
